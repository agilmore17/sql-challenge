Ninth Challenge for UofR Data Bootcamp

One of the things that was challenging for this assignment was importing the datasets. For some reason, I kept getting a "columns" error when trying to import, so I had to turn online to find an answer. Someone on Reddit came up with a work around to fix the issue, and I copied that code and applied it to my project specifically. Apart from that, everything else was done using class notes & re-watching the recordings of a few classes!
